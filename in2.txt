Device-to-device communication is a technology that enables adjacent devices to communicate directly without passing through an infrastructure of access points or base stations. D2D communication enhances spectral efficiency by spatially reusing radio resource. In addition, it prolongs battery life of user devices by reducing the transmission power. In cellular networks using DD communication, an efficient resource management scheme is needed to support spatial reuse of radio resource while minimizing the intra-cell interference between links which coexist on the same radio resource.
